We need

- priority queue: try using std::priority_queue<> for the time being
  - a class which represents an Event, the base class for objects which can be put into the queue
  - derived classes for SiteEvent and CircleEvent
- a balanced binary tree, with interior nodes and leaves having significant values: research (buy or build ;^)~ )
- a DCEL, enhanced with additional tracking
